# Devs-TheGame
This is a experiment. The procedure is very simple, This will be a basic Godot v4.3 game . And Its free for all. Anybody can implement anything. Change any file, even change the whole story of the game. Its up to you 

## Rules
- The First Person to raise a PR can set the standards of the game , either it be a 2D or 3D game . And once this is set These are Absolute. And cant be changed.
- I will be checking the PRs on weekly basis. And merging them if and only if it doesn't break the game.

### God knows what it will be turned into
- I will be publishing the most stable version of the game on monthly basis

### The Contributor Notes
- The person who raise the first PR add some thing fun or guideline or a warning ðŸ’€ here and then @yourname or its totally up to you
